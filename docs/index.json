    "body": "What happens in a hypnotherapy session There are different types of hypnotherapy, and different ways of hypnotising someone.\nFirst, you\u0026rsquo;ll usually have a talk with your therapist to discuss what you hope to achieve and agree what methods your therapist will use.\nAfter this, the hypnotherapist may:\nlead you into a deeply relaxed state – most people feel refreshed and relaxed use your agreed methods to help you towards your goals – for example, suggesting that you do not want to carry out a certain habit gradually bring you out of the trance-like state. Most people feel refreshed and relaxed You\u0026rsquo;re fully in control when under hypnosis and do not have to take on the therapist\u0026rsquo;s suggestions if you do not want to. If necessary, you can bring yourself out of the hypnotic state.\nHypnosis does not work if you do not want to be hypnotised.\n",

    "body": "Clinical Hypnotherapist I support people making positive change and I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about helping others to help themselves.\nFor decades, I thrived in my IT career alongside my life of family, friends, hobbies and interests. BUT… life became quite complex from juggling family responsibilities alongside work, the loss of loved ones and striving to keep everything in my world moving along. Self-care became challenging, unhelpful emotions and physical problems started to emerge. Why was this happening to me?\nAfter a friend suggested a hypnotherapist, I was thankful for their non-judgemental and objective therapy. I\u0026rsquo;d been so busy stuck in a loop of thoughts, emotions and behaviours… but the hypnosis allowed me to focus on my priorities and to explore new ways forward. It truly made a difference to me in just a few sessions. My eyes were now wide open!\nI trained in clinical hypnotherapy because I strongly believe in the mind-body connection and I value best practice. As you\u0026rsquo;ll read in my Welcome and Services sections, there are many ways in which hypnosis can be helpful and supportive for stressful situations, unhelpful fears, habits and cravings, physical symptoms and persistent pain. It can boost your mental focus towards achieving your goals.\nI hold a Diploma in Clinical Hypnotherapy and as a registered member of the UK’s National Hypnotherapy Council, I am insured and bound to a code of ethics and confidentiality, undertaking regular supervision sessions and Continuing Professional Development.\nPlease read my Hypnotherapy Practice Privacy Policy here. insert link\n",

    "body": "HYPNOSIS How many times have you become engrossed in a good book or film? It\u0026rsquo;s easy to lose track of time if it\u0026rsquo;s really absorbing, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? That\u0026rsquo;s an example of focused attention.\nHypnosis is a completely natural state of focused attention. We might enter this state several times a day and will have experienced it reading a good book, watching a film, doing activities, going on a journey and in many other ways. We can decide how much we want to engage in that experience, or we can come out of it quickly if interrupted by something we feel is urgent.\nMany people who have undertaken hypnosis say it\u0026rsquo;s relaxing. Relaxation is certainly good for our wellbeing and calming the parasympathetic nervous system, key to focusing on ourselves and exploring possibilities from within. Deeper levels of hypnotic trance can be experienced during hypnotherapy to further connect with the subconscious mind for working on inner solutions. This also happens naturally during sleeping - perhaps you recall waking after a good sleep with the answer to a problem that\u0026rsquo;s been on your mind? But hypnosis is not a state of sleep, even though the term comes from the Greek ‘hypnos’ meaning ‘sleep’, rather it is a state of mind in which the subconscious is able to communicate with the conscious mind.\nHYPNOTHERAPY We can bring about hypnosis, this natural state of altered state of awareness, by ourselves. Much can be achieved through self-hypnosis, however, without some guidance, this can be limited by our personal subjective and conscious viewpoint. A trained professional can help facilitate hypnosis to encourage a person’s desired beneficial change, essentially guided by the person’s own inner beliefs.\nHypnotherapy is a holistic talking therapy that uses hypnosis in a clinical setting as part of a tailored treatment plan to support a person towards desired beneficial change. It has already been recognised by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as effective in the management for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Currently, the NHS offer very limited access to hypnotherapy services. But the word has been out for a long time, gaining wider acknowledgement through continuing scientific research and testimonials, that using hypnosis draws on the power of the mind for positive effect.\nAlongside hypnosis, I use other psychotherapeutic techniques to suit my clients, taking into account their feedback on progress. I explain the rationale for each technique in a teaching style to enable clients to practise themselves between and beyond therapy sessions.\nBefore starting any therapy, it\u0026rsquo;s important to find out if it\u0026rsquo;s right for you and whether you are comfortable working with me. My online clients can organise their therapy sessions around their schedule, in their own familiar and comfortable space.\nThe first step is to contact me for a brief and confidential chat about what you are looking to change or achieve. Please consider taking this short step - just talking about it with me may bring a sense of less distress, less discomfort and potentially lighten the mood and be motivating. By the end, you will know how comfortable you feel about working with me.\nI can work with clients to support the following: STRESS and ANXIETY\nFEARS and PHOBIAS\nCRAVINGS\nSLEEP PROBLEMS\nBOOSTING CONFIDENCE\nMENOPAUSE\nPERSISTENT PAIN\nStill thinking about it? When you are ready, please do contact me here. so that I can answer any questions you may have.\n",
