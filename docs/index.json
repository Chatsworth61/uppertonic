    "body": "Know what you want? It may be easy to identify what’s not working for you and what you want to change, but how to make the change might be more elusive. What I share with you here may surprise you….\nTry changing your grip For anyone who wants to learn to ski or snowboard, controlling speed down a slope is an obvious skill that requires mastering early on. After the basics of balancing on the platform strapped to the feet, it’s natural to fear going straight down too fast - after all, we learnt after early childhood that falling can hurt.\nSo how to control speed when free-falling down the slope? One way is to steer away from the route straight down and balance on the hard edge against the mountain. When fearful, that intuitively leads to throwing the shoulders inwards towards the slope as if to \u0026lsquo;hug\u0026rsquo; safety but actually throws balance off and loses control. Instead, if the shoulders and upper body are directed outwards to the valley below, focusing on the destination and leaning away from the mountain even if it\u0026rsquo;s a bit scary, the glide is just allowed to happen at a comfortable speed.\nWith repetition, the counter-intuitive leaning away from perceived safety and leaning into any fear becomes more familiar and intuitive. Like any sport, practice is key to mastering a sequence of movements until it becomes tuned and second nature. In a similar way, we can focus on an elusive change we want to make, even if we don’t know how, step outside our comfort zone, try changing the grip and glide to the destination.\n",

    "body": "Amanda Upperton, MNCH(Reg.), Clinical Hypnotherapist\nI support people making positive change and I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about helping others to help themselves.\nFor decades, I thrived in my IT career alongside my life of family, friends, hobbies and interests. But life became quite complex from juggling family responsibilities alongside work, the loss of loved ones and striving to keep everything in my world moving along. Unhelpful emotions and physical problems started to emerge and things seemed less in my control.\nWhen a friend suggested seeing a hypnotherapist, this was like unlocking a door for me. Much earlier in life I\u0026rsquo;d been curious about hypnosis - and now I was really appreciating my therapist’s non-judgemental approach in my time of crisis. I\u0026rsquo;d become stuck in a loop of thoughts, emotions and behaviours… but the hypnotherapy allowed me to focus on my priorities and to explore new ways forward. It truly made a big difference to me in just a few sessions.\nWith a desire to help make a difference for others, I trained in clinical hypnotherapy because I strongly believe in the power of the mind and in the mind-body connection. As you\u0026rsquo;ll read in my Welcome and Services sections, there are many ways in which hypnotherapy can be helpful and supportive for stressful situations, unhelpful fears, habits and cravings, physical symptoms and persistent pain. Hypnosis can boost your mental focus towards achieving your goals.\nI hold a Diploma in Clinical Hypnotherapy and as a registered member of the UK’s National Hypnotherapy Council (NCH), I am insured and bound to a code of ethics and confidentiality, undertaking regular supervision sessions and Continuing Professional Development.\nPlease read my Privacy Policy here\n",

    "body": "HYPNOSIS How many times have you been engrossed in a good book or film? It\u0026rsquo;s easy to lose track of time if it\u0026rsquo;s really absorbing, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? That\u0026rsquo;s an example of focused attention.\nHypnosis is a completely natural state of focused attention. We might enter this state several times a day and will have experienced it reading a good book, watching a film, doing various activities, going on a journey and in many other ways. We can decide how much we want to engage in that experience, or we can come out of it quickly if interrupted by something we feel is urgent.\nMany people who have undertaken hypnosis say it\u0026rsquo;s relaxing. Relaxation is certainly good for our wellbeing and calming the parasympathetic nervous system, key to focusing on ourselves and exploring possibilities from within. Deeper levels of hypnotic trance can be experienced during hypnotherapy to further connect with the subconscious mind for working on inner solutions. A similar effect happens naturally during sleeping - perhaps you recall waking after a good sleep with the answer to a problem that\u0026rsquo;s been on your mind?\nHYPNOTHERAPY We can bring about hypnosis, this natural altered state of awareness, by ourselves. Much can be achieved through self-hypnosis, however, without some guidance, this can be limited by our personal subjective conscious viewpoint. A trained professional can facilitate hypnosis to encourage a person’s desired positive change to their thoughts and feelings by suggestion and guide them to a more helpful perspective.\nClinical hypnotherapy is a holistic talking therapy, as part of a tailored treatment plan, to support a person towards their desired beneficial change. Particularly over the last 20+ years, hypnotherapy has played a growing role in mind-body interventions. Through continuing scientific research and testimonials, there is increasing wider acknowledgement that using hypnosis draws on the power of the mind for positive effect. Hypnotherapy has been recognised by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as effective in the management for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Currently, the NHS offer very limited access to hypnotherapy services.\nWORKING WITH ME I mainly provide online therapy sessions for clients via Zoom and find this works well. I’m based in Waterlooville and can arrange to see clients face-to-face at local clinic rooms in the Portsmouth area.\nUsing a range of talking therapy techniques to suit my clients, I explain the rationale for each technique in a teaching style so that clients can practise themselves between and beyond therapy sessions, including self-hypnosis.\nBefore starting any therapy, it\u0026rsquo;s important to find out if it\u0026rsquo;s right for you and whether you are comfortable working with me. My online clients can organise their therapy sessions around their schedule, in their own familiar and comfortable space.\nThe first step is to contact me for a brief and confidential chat about what you are looking to change or achieve. Please consider taking this short step - just talking about it with me may bring a sense of less distress, less discomfort and potentially lighten the mood and be motivating.\nI can work with clients to support the following:\nSTRESS and ANXIETY\nFEARS and PHOBIAS\nCRAVINGS\nSLEEP PROBLEMS\nPAIN MANAGEMENT\nMENOPAUSE\nBOOSTING CONFIDENCE\nStill thinking about it? When you are ready, please do contact me here. so that I can answer any questions you may have. HYPNOTHERAPY SESSION FEES I provide a tailored hypnotherapy service to each client. By listening and asking some questions to understand the situation and what change or improvement is wanted, a therapeutic plan is developed from the first session.\nWhy not request a free call and discover how this could work for you? On hearing what you wish to achieve, I can guide on how many sessions may be suitable. I’m happy to answer your questions and there’s no obligation to proceed.\nInitial confidential chat approximately 20 minutes Free First session, including consultation approximately 60 - 90 minutes £80 Subsequent therapy sessions each session up to approximately 60 minutes £60 Cost for the first 3 sessions (£80+£60+£60) £200 or, for first 3 sessions purchased together - saving £20 £180 Cost for the first 5 sessions (£80+£60+£60+£60+£60) £320 or, for first 5 sessions purchased together - saving £50 £270 Other savings may be available in some circumstances. I request payment in advance to confirm each session booking, or in advance of the first session of a bundle of sessions purchased together. My cancellation policy is 24 hours in advance of a booked and purchased session.\nWhen your first session is booked and confirmed, look forward to your ‘me time’ in a private and supportive environment. I’ll look forward to working with you towards your aspirations - whether that’s easing anxiety and discomfort or improving confidence to move forward.\n",
