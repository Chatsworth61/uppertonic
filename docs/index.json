    "body": "Starting with you Are you back into your usual routine? Perhaps there seem to be so many tasks on your plate, your head feels in the clouds. Perhaps you want something to change but you just can\u0026rsquo;t see how. When it\u0026rsquo;s a bit foggy it can seem easier to carry on as usual. If you\u0026rsquo;ve read this far, you\u0026rsquo;ve already stopped for a few moments and maybe curious to start making that difference\u0026hellip; easily.\nStart something new Instead of trying to fix what hasn\u0026rsquo;t been working well for you, why not try something new today for 5 minutes?\nIt can be anything that makes you smile, laugh, move a little more, clean something, tidy a small area, do a puzzle, listen to music, sing/hum\u0026hellip; And you could choose to do the same thing for 5 minutes tomorrow if it was fun or was helpful to you, or you could choose to try something different for the 5 minutes.\nCreating a habit of taking short breaks allows the mind to change focus and create new perspectives.\nThis might seem simply obvious or obviously simple, but often it\u0026rsquo;s the simple things that make such a difference.\n",

    "body": "Amanda Upperton, MNCH(Reg.), Clinical Hypnotherapist\nI support people making positive change and I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about helping others to help themselves.\nFor decades, I thrived in my IT career alongside my life of family, friends, hobbies and interests. BUT… life became quite complex from juggling family responsibilities alongside work, the loss of loved ones and striving to keep everything in my world moving along. Self-care became challenging, unhelpful emotions and physical problems started to emerge. Feeling less in control of my future was difficult to accept.\nA friend suggested I see a hypnotherapist and this was like unlocking a door for me. I had read about hypnosis when I was much younger and now appreciated the therapist’s non-judgemental approach. I\u0026rsquo;d been so busy stuck in a loop of thoughts, emotions and behaviours… but the hypnosis allowed me to focus on my priorities and to explore new ways forward. It truly made a difference to me in just a few sessions.\nWith a desire to help make a difference for others, I trained in clinical hypnotherapy because I strongly believe in the mind-body connection. As you\u0026rsquo;ll read in my Welcome and Services sections, there are many ways in which hypnosis can be helpful and supportive for stressful situations, unhelpful fears, habits and cravings, physical symptoms and persistent pain. Hypnosis can boost your mental focus towards achieving your goals.\nI hold a Diploma in Clinical Hypnotherapy and as a registered member of the UK’s National Hypnotherapy Council (NCH), I am insured and bound to a code of ethics and confidentiality, undertaking regular supervision sessions and Continuing Professional Development.\nPlease read my Privacy Policy here\n",

    "body": "HYPNOSIS How many times have you become engrossed in a good book or film? It\u0026rsquo;s easy to lose track of time if it\u0026rsquo;s really absorbing, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? That\u0026rsquo;s an example of focused attention.\nHypnosis is a completely natural state of focused attention. We might enter this state several times a day and will have experienced it reading a good book, watching a film, doing various activities, going on a journey and in many other ways. We can decide how much we want to engage in that experience, or we can come out of it quickly if interrupted by something we feel is urgent.\nMany people who have undertaken hypnosis say it\u0026rsquo;s relaxing. Relaxation is certainly good for our wellbeing and calming the parasympathetic nervous system, key to focusing on ourselves and exploring possibilities from within. Deeper levels of hypnotic trance can be experienced during hypnotherapy to further connect with the subconscious mind for working on inner solutions. A similar effect happens naturally during sleeping - perhaps you recall waking after a good sleep with the answer to a problem that\u0026rsquo;s been on your mind?\nHYPNOTHERAPY We can bring about hypnosis, this natural altered state of awareness, by ourselves. Much can be achieved through self-hypnosis, however, without some guidance, this can be limited by our personal subjective conscious viewpoint. A trained professional can facilitate hypnosis to encourage a person’s desired positive change to their thoughts and feelings by suggestion and guiding them to a more helpful perspective.\nHypnotherapy is a holistic talking therapy in a clinical setting as part of a tailored treatment plan to support a person towards desired beneficial change. It has already been recognised by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as effective in the management for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Currently, the NHS offer very limited access to hypnotherapy services. Particularly over the last 20+ years, Hypnotherapy has played a growing role in mind-body interventions, gaining wider acknowledgement through continuing scientific research and testimonials that using hypnosis draws on the power of the mind for positive effect.\nWORKING WITH ME I use a range of talking therapy techniques to suit my clients. I explain the rationale for each technique in a teaching style to enable clients to practise themselves between and beyond therapy sessions, including self-hypnosis.\nBefore starting any therapy, it\u0026rsquo;s important to find out if it\u0026rsquo;s right for you and whether you are comfortable working with me. My online clients can organise their therapy sessions around their schedule, in their own familiar and comfortable space.\nThe first step is to contact me for a brief and confidential chat about what you are looking to change or achieve. Please consider taking this short step - just talking about it with me may bring a sense of less distress, less discomfort and potentially lighten the mood and be motivating.\nI can work with clients to support the following:\nSTRESS and ANXIETY\nFEARS and PHOBIAS\nCRAVINGS\nSLEEP PROBLEMS\nBOOSTING CONFIDENCE\nMENOPAUSE\nPERSISTENT PAIN\nStill thinking about it? When you are ready, please do contact me here. so that I can answer any questions you may have. HYPNOTHERAPY SESSION FEES I provide a tailored hypnotherapy service to each client. By listening and asking some questions to understand the situation and what change or improvement is wanted, a therapeutic plan is developed from the first session.\nWhy not request a free call and discover how this could work for you? On hearing what you wish to achieve, I can guide on how many sessions may be suitable. I’m happy to answer your questions and there’s no obligation to proceed.\nInitial confidential chat approximately 20 minutes Free First session, including consultation approximately 60 - 90 minutes £80 Subsequent therapy sessions each session up to approximately 60 minutes £60 Cost for the first 3 sessions (£80+£60+£60) £200 or, for first 3 sessions purchased together - saving £20 £180 Cost for the first 5 sessions (£80+£60+£60+£60+£60) £320 or, for first 5 sessions purchased together - saving £50 £270 Other savings may be available in some circumstances. I ask for payment in advance to confirm each session booking, or in advance of the first session of a bundle of sessions purchased together. My cancellation policy is 24 hours in advance of a booked and purchased session.\nWhen the first session is booked and confirmed, look forward to your ‘me time’ in a private and supportive environment. I’ll look forward to working with you towards your aspirations - whether that’s easing anxiety and discomfort or improving confidence to move forward.\n",
