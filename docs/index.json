    "body": "Sunset re-set More daylight hours are very welcome for our general wellbeing. Re-setting a good bedtime routine is helpful for improving sleep quality and making the most of the next day too. The more we practise good routines, the more they become good habits.\nSo how often do we take a look at our bedtime routine? What\u0026rsquo;s the point? Do we even have time to? Falling into bed exhausted at the end of the day is just inevitable, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Or, it can be tempting to stay up late again. What\u0026rsquo;s your normal?\nOur modern lifestyles tend to continue at pace. Working days/nights probably have the same start and finish times all year round. We also prioritise routines around mealtimes, family-time, healthcare, social groups and whatever else seems important - then all too soon it\u0026rsquo;s time for sleep. Our bedtime sleep routine is important and is too often overlooked or compromised.\nRoutine Sundown tips Set a reminder timer to start winding down. Ideally 30-60 minutes before you want to be going to sleep.\nReduce lighting to signal to the brain that it\u0026rsquo;s nearly time for sleep, just as a sunset signals to animals in the wild.\nNo screens in the 30 minutes before sleep as this may keep the brain from going into sleep mode. (Don\u0026rsquo;t ignore this one).\nSet a more calming mood maybe with soft music, gentle aromas, a few yoga poses, read a few pages of a book.\nWrite down something you are grateful for today.\nTake a deeper breath in, hold it for a few seconds\u0026hellip; then let it out and imagine letting out all of the cares of the day.\nThink about sighing and yawning\u0026hellip; then smile and welcome sleepiness.\n",

    "body": "Know what you want? It may be easy to identify what’s not working for you and what you want to change, but how to make the change might be more elusive. What I share here may surprise you…\nTry changing your grip When we\u0026rsquo;re apprehensive or fearful, we can recognise feelings of being tensed up. For anyone who wants to learn to ski or snowboard, controlling speed down a slope is an obvious skill that requires mastering early on. It’s natural to fear going straight down too fast - that\u0026rsquo;s our subconscious survival response to the perceived risk of getting hurt.\nSo, feeling like a novice in unfamiliar terrain, how to control speeding down the ski slope? One way is to steer a bit of an angle away from \u0026lsquo;straight down\u0026rsquo;. When fearful of going a bit too fast for comfort, there\u0026rsquo;s an intuitive tendency to throw the shoulders inwards towards the mountain slope as if to grip onto or \u0026lsquo;hug\u0026rsquo; safety, but this actually throws balance off and loses control - body and mind are not in harmony. Instead, if the shoulders and upper body lean towards the valley below, leaning away from the mountain (even if it\u0026rsquo;s a bit scary) and focusing on the destination, the glide is just allowed to happen at a more comfortable speed. More angled turns can be made to zig-zag in stages safely to the bottom.\nWith repetition, the counter-intuitive leaning away from perceived safety and leaning into any fear becomes more familiar and intuitive. Like any sport, practice is key to mastering a sequence of movements until it becomes tuned and second nature. In a similar way, we can focus on an elusive change we want to make, even if we don’t know how, step outside our comfort zone, try changing the grip and start gliding towards the destination.\n",

    "body": "Amanda H Upperton, MNCH(Reg.), Clinical Hypnotherapist\nI support people to make positive change and I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about helping others to help themselves.\nFor decades, I thrived in my IT career alongside my life of family, friends, hobbies and interests. But life became quite complex from juggling family responsibilities alongside work, the loss of loved ones and striving to keep everything in my world moving along. Unhelpful emotions and physical problems started to emerge and things seemed less in my control.\nWhen a friend suggested seeing a hypnotherapist, it was like opening a forgotten door for me. Much earlier in life I\u0026rsquo;d been curious about hypnosis and some potential benefits. Now, I was really appreciating my therapist’s non-judgemental approach and was gently guided to what I described as my calm inner place. It became clear that I\u0026rsquo;d become stuck in a loop of thoughts, emotions and behaviours… but the hypnotherapy allowed me to focus on my priorities and to explore new ways forward. It truly made a big difference to me in just a few sessions.\nWith a desire to help make a difference for others, I trained in clinical hypnotherapy because I strongly believe in the power of the mind and in the mind-body connection. As you\u0026rsquo;ll read in my Welcome and Services sections, there are many ways in which hypnotherapy can be supportive for stressful situations, unhelpful feelings, habits and cravings, physical symptoms and perceived persistent pain. Hypnosis can boost your mental focus and confidence towards achieving your goals.\nI hold a Diploma in Clinical Hypnotherapy and as a registered member of the UK’s National Hypnotherapy Council (NCH), I am insured and bound to a code of ethics and confidentiality, undertaking regular supervision sessions and Continuing Professional Development.\n",

    "body": "HYPNOSIS How many times have you been engrossed in a good book or film? It\u0026rsquo;s easy to lose track of time if it\u0026rsquo;s really absorbing, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? That\u0026rsquo;s an example of focused attention.\nHypnosis is a completely natural state of focused attention. We might enter this state several times a day and will have experienced it reading a good book, watching a film, doing various activities, going on a journey and in many other ways. We can decide how much we want to engage in that experience, or we can come out of it quickly if interrupted by something we sense is urgent.\nMany people who have undertaken hypnosis say it\u0026rsquo;s relaxing. Relaxation is certainly good for our wellbeing and calming the parasympathetic nervous system, key to focusing on ourselves and exploring possibilities from within. Deeper levels of hypnotic trance can be experienced during hypnotherapy to further connect with the subconscious mind for working on inner solutions. A similar effect happens naturally during sleeping - perhaps you recall waking after a good sleep with the answer to a problem that\u0026rsquo;s been on your mind?\nHYPNOTHERAPY We can bring about hypnosis, this natural altered state of awareness, by ourselves. Much can be achieved through self-hypnosis, but without some guidance, this can be limited by our personal subjective conscious viewpoint. A qualified clinical hypnotherapist will start with a consultation session and listen carefully to what\u0026rsquo;s concerning their client and/or what they wish to change and achieve. Through hypnosis, the person is guided towards a more helpful perspective, encouraging their desired positive change in thoughts, feelings and behaviours. We are all different, so the hypnotherapy is tailored to the person and takes into account any feedback from them.\nParticularly over the last 20+ years, hypnotherapy has played a growing role in mind-body interventions. Through continuing scientific research and testimonials, there is increasing wider acknowledgement that using hypnosis draws on the power of the mind for positive effect.\nHypnotherapy is a complementary therapy and may be provided alongside professional healthcare but is not a substitute for essential healthcare.\nWORKING WITH ME I mainly provide online therapy sessions and find this works well. I’m based in Waterlooville, Hampshire and can arrange to see clients face-to-face at suitable local hired venues in the Portsmouth area when available.\nUsing a range of talking therapy, coaching and NLP techniques to suit my clients, I explain the techniques in a teaching style so that clients can practise between and beyond therapy sessions, including self-hypnosis.\nBefore starting any therapy, it\u0026rsquo;s important to find out if it\u0026rsquo;s right for you and whether you are comfortable working with me. My online clients can organise their therapy sessions around their schedule, in their own familiar and comfortable space.\nThe first step is to contact me for a brief and confidential chat about what you are looking to change or achieve. Please consider taking this short step - just talking about it with me may bring a sense of calm and potentially lighten the mood and be motivating.\nI can work with clients to support the following:\nSTRESS and ANXIETY\nPHOBIAS\nUNHELPFUL HABITS\nSLEEP PROBLEMS\nPAIN MANAGEMENT\nBOOSTING CONFIDENCE\nStill thinking about it? When you are ready, please do contact me here so that I can answer any questions you may have. HYPNOTHERAPY SESSION FEES I provide a tailored hypnotherapy service to each client. By listening and asking some questions to understand the situation and what change or improvement is wanted, a therapeutic plan is developed from the first session.\nWhy not request a free call and discover how this could work for you? On hearing what you wish to achieve, I can guide on how many sessions may be suitable. I’m happy to answer your questions and there’s no obligation to proceed.\nInitial confidential chat approximately 20 minutes Free First session, including consultation approximately 60 - 90 minutes £80 Subsequent therapy sessions each session up to approximately 60 minutes £60 Some issues only require a few sessions, while more complex issues may benefit from working through several sessions.\nSavings can be made by purchasing a bundle of sessions together, depending on offers at the time. Other savings may be available in some circumstances.\nI request payment in advance to confirm each session booking, or in advance of the first session of a bundle of sessions purchased together. My cancellation policy is 24 hours in advance of a booked and purchased session in order to receive a full payment refund with no cancellation charge. Otherwise the full session fee will be charged. If you want to reschedule, please let me have at least 24 hours notice.\nWhen your first session is booked and confirmed, look forward to your ‘me time’ in a private and supportive environment. I’ll look forward to working with you towards your aspirations - whether that’s easing anxiety and discomfort or improving confidence to move forward.\n",
