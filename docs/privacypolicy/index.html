<p>This privacy policy sets out how Uppertonic Hypnotherapy uses and protects the information you provide when accessing my website. I intend to ensure any data you provide is kept secure, managed respectfully and only used for the purposes for which it has been provided.</p>
<p>Contact details <br>
Name: Amanda Upperton <br>
E-mail: <a href="mailto:privacy@uppertonic.co.uk">privacy@uppertonic.co.uk</a> <br>
Website: Uppertonic.co.uk</p>

accept cookies but you can modify your settings to decline them if you prefer. If you
choose to do this you may find that you cannot make full use of my website.</p>
<h3 id="links-to-other-websites">Links to other websites</h3>
<p>My website may contain links to other websites. However, once you use
these links please be aware that you have left my website and I do not have any

<h3 id="links-to-social-media">Links to social media</h3>

<h3 id="reviews">Reviews</h3>
<p>Subject to your prior consent, I may publish information you provide about services you received from me as a Review on my website. Such information may be available, via the internet, around the world. I cannot prevent the use (or misuse) of such information by others. So, an anonymised, initials only or partial name review may be preferable to you and you may wish to limit your review to the service provided rather than your reason for requesting my services. To have your review deleted from my website, please contact me by email.</p>
<h2 id="information-regarding-collection-of-your-data">INFORMATION REGARDING COLLECTION OF YOUR DATA</h2>
<h3 id="your-information">Your Information</h3>
<p>You may wish to provide your information when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You make a request for information from me such as an enquiry;</li>
<li>You choose to contact me for an initial call or an appointment.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you contact me via my website form, the information you provide is transferred securely to my email. When you contact me via my website contact form, direct email or phone I will collect your Name, Email Address, Telephone Number(s) and any information you choose to supply regarding the purpose of your enquiry.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-this-information-used-and-retained">How is this information used and retained?</h3>
<p>I use this information to make contact with you, provide you with information you requested and/or to discuss your requirements for the purpose of offering you an appointment and/or provision of service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your data will be used to enable me to contact you about your query, requirements or requested service.</li>
<li>Should you wish to book a therapeutic session appointment, I shall supply a copy of my Client Privacy Policy which is in line with industry regulations including insurance purposes and my tax responsibilities. It explains how your data will be collected, used and retained as a client of Uppertonic Hypnotherapy.</li>
<li>If you do not wish to make an appointment, your email and your contact information will be securely deleted/destroyed after one year.</li>
<li>If you sign up for my regular emailing list, I will retain your information until you unsubscribe from this service.</li>
<li>I may also use this information so that I may improve my services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) effective from May 2018, you have the following rights: <br></p>
<ul>
<li>the right to be informed: which is why I produced this policy.</li>
<li>the right of access: if you wish to see your file then please make a request in writing to the Data Processor as below. I will provide you with the information within 30 days of your request.</li>
<li>the right to rectification: this is your right to request changes to any information I hold that is factually inaccurate. If you believe any of the information I hold on you is incorrect, then please let me know as soon as possible and I will make the relevant changes.</li>
<li>the right to erasure, also termed ‘the right to be forgotten’:  this Uppertonic Hypnotherapy privacy policy concerns prospective clients only and as such your details will be retained only as outlined above, after this your information will be securely destroyed. Should you wish your data to be erased more urgently then please make a request in writing to the Data Processor as below.</li>
<li>the right to restrict processing: I will only use the information for the purposes that I have stated above. I uphold the common law principles of confidentiality where the duty to keep confidence is measured against the concept of ‘greater good’. If in my opinion as a therapist there is good reason to believe not to disclose would cause danger or serious harm to self, the therapist or others, then appropriate agencies may be contacted. Only information required to ensure safety of relevant parties would be disclosed. Information may have to be disclosed without consent for the prevention, detection or prosecution of a crime. The sharing of anonymous case histories with supervisors and peer support groups is not a breach of professional confidentiality.</li>
<li>the right to data portability: this right is more relevant to IT companies, e.g. the sharing of information when moving from one utility provider to another. I will not share your information without your specific consent, other than in the situations described above.</li>
<li>the right to object: I will not contact you for marketing purposes unless you have given me specific consent to do so.</li>
<li>the right not to be subject to automated decision-making including profiling: I will not use your information for profiling purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please contact me if you have any questions regarding this policy which is intended to clearly present and help you understand your data privacy rights under the General Data Protection laws of the UK.  I believe this policy is aligned to the general data protection law requirements of Ireland and Europe. Any claim relating to Uppertonic Hypnotherapy services, products or website shall be governed by the laws of the UK without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
<p>Your data will be stored on website servers and backup servers within the European Economic Area (EEA) and by me on secure laptops and phones.</p>
