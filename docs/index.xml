      <description>What happens in a hypnotherapy session There are different types of hypnotherapy, and different ways of hypnotising someone.
First, you&amp;rsquo;ll usually have a talk with your therapist to discuss what you hope to achieve and agree what methods your therapist will use.
After this, the hypnotherapist may:
lead you into a deeply relaxed state – most people feel refreshed and relaxed use your agreed methods to help you towards your goals – for example, suggesting that you do not want to carry out a certain habit gradually bring you out of the trance-like state.</description>

      <description>Amanda Upperton - Clinical Hypnotherapist I support people making positive change and I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about helping others to help themselves.
For decades, I thrived in my IT career alongside my life of family, friends, hobbies and interests. BUT… life became quite complex from juggling family responsibilities alongside work, the loss of loved ones and striving to keep everything in my world moving along. Self-care became challenging, unhelpful emotions and physical problems started to emerge.</description>

      <description>HYPNOSIS How many times have you become engrossed in a good book or film? It&amp;rsquo;s easy to lose track of time if it&amp;rsquo;s really absorbing, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? That&amp;rsquo;s an example of focused attention.
Hypnosis is a completely natural state of focused attention. We might enter this state several times a day and will have experienced it reading a good book, watching a film, doing activities, going on a journey and in many other ways.</description>
