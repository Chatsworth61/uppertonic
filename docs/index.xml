      <description>Amanda Upperton, MNCH(Reg.), Clinical Hypnotherapist
I support people making positive change and I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about helping others to help themselves.
For decades, I thrived in my IT career alongside my life of family, friends, hobbies and interests. BUTâ€¦ life became quite complex from juggling family responsibilities alongside work, the loss of loved ones and striving to keep everything in my world moving along. Self-care became challenging, unhelpful emotions and physical problems started to emerge.</description>

      <description>HYPNOSIS How many times have you become engrossed in a good book or film? It&amp;rsquo;s easy to lose track of time if it&amp;rsquo;s really absorbing, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? That&amp;rsquo;s an example of focused attention.
Hypnosis is a completely natural state of focused attention. We might enter this state several times a day and will have experienced it reading a good book, watching a film, doing various activities, going on a journey and in many other ways.</description>
