<p style="font-size: 24px;font-weight:bold;">Amanda Upperton, MNCH(Reg.), Clinical Hypnotherapist</p>

I support people making positive change and I'm passionate about helping others to help themselves.

* For decades, I thrived in my IT career alongside my life of family, friends, hobbies and interests.  BUT… life became quite complex from juggling family responsibilities alongside work, the loss of loved ones and striving to keep everything in my world moving along.  Self-care became challenging, unhelpful emotions and physical problems started to emerge. Feeling less in control of my future was difficult to accept.
 
* A friend suggested I see a hypnotherapist and this was like unlocking a door for me. I had read about hypnosis when I was much younger and now appreciated the therapist’s non-judgemental approach.  I'd been so busy stuck in a loop of thoughts, emotions and behaviours… but the hypnosis allowed me to focus on my priorities and to explore new ways forward.  It truly made a difference to me in just a few sessions.
 
With a desire to help make a difference for others, I trained in clinical hypnotherapy because I strongly believe in the mind-body connection.  As you'll read in my Welcome and Services sections, there are many ways in which hypnosis can be helpful and supportive for stressful situations, unhelpful fears, habits and cravings, physical symptoms and persistent pain.  Hypnosis can boost your mental focus towards achieving your goals.
 
I hold a Diploma in Clinical Hypnotherapy and as a registered member of the UK’s National Hypnotherapy Council (NCH), I am insured and bound to a code of ethics and confidentiality, undertaking regular supervision sessions and Continuing Professional Development.
