## <p style="text-align: center;">Hello and welcome to Uppertonic Hypnotherapy

**<center>If you are curious about supporting your wellbeing, then please ***just relax*** and read on…</center>**
 
With so much information ‘out there’ about wellbeing and the importance of mental health, 
I invite you to pause right here for a few moments and really focus on what you are looking for, what outcome is important to you?  
In any aspect of your life, are you looking for...

LESS OF ANY OF THESE?
<p style="text-align: center;">Anxiety ~ Discomfort ~ Fearfulness ~ Feeling misunderstood ~ Missing out ~ Overwhelm ~ Procrastination ~ Sadness ~ <br>Stuck in a rut ~ Unhelpful habits ~ Uncomfortable feelings

or &nbsp; MORE OF ANY OF THESE?
<p style="text-align: center;">Comfort ~ Confidence ~ Creativity ~ Energy ~ Harmony ~ Joy ~ Motivation ~ Optimism ~ Resilience ~ Self-esteem ~ Sleep

We know ourselves better than anyone else, so it can be unsettling if we seem to lose track of our own compass and don't feel able to be our best selves.  Perhaps despite well-intentioned efforts, problems often get in the way, or how to go about achieving a wanted change seems elusive.  These are normal thoughts and associated feelings, especially during busy times, but also in times of lower energy.

Whatever your concerns or aspirations, I offer you a free, no-obligation and confidential chat to briefly discuss how a hypnotherapy treatment plan could make a difference to you.  As a qualified hypnotherapist, I use a range of talking therapy, coaching and NLP techniques.

Please read [**about me**]({{< ref "/about" >}} "about me") and my [**services**]({{< ref "/services" >}} "services"). &nbsp; Thanks for visiting :relaxed:

Best wishes, <br>
Amanda
