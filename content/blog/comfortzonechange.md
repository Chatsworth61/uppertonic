## Know what you want?

It may be easy to identify what’s not working for you and what you want to change, but how to make the change might be more elusive. What I share with you here may surprise you….


## Try changing your grip

For anyone who wants to learn to ski or snowboard, controlling speed down a slope is an obvious skill that requires mastering early on. After the basics of balancing on the platform strapped to the feet, it’s natural to fear going straight down too fast - after all, we learnt after early childhood that falling can hurt.

So how to control speed when free-falling down the slope? One way is to steer away from the route straight down and balance on the hard edge against the mountain. When fearful, that intuitively leads to throwing the shoulders inwards towards the slope as if to 'hug' safety but actually throws balance off and loses control.  Instead, if the shoulders and upper body are directed outwards to the valley below, focusing on the destination and leaning away from the mountain even if it's a bit scary, the glide is just allowed to happen at a comfortable speed.

With repetition, the counter-intuitive leaning away from perceived safety and leaning into any fear becomes more familiar and intuitive. Like any sport, practice is key to mastering a sequence of movements until it becomes tuned and second nature. In a similar way, we can focus on an elusive change we want to make, even if we don’t know how, step outside our comfort zone, try changing the grip and glide to the destination.
