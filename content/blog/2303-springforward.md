## Sunset re-set

More daylight hours are very welcome for our general wellbeing.  Re-setting a good bedtime routine is helpful for improving sleep quality and making the most of the next day too. The more we practise good routines, the more they become good habits.

So how often do we take a look at our bedtime routine? What's the point? Do we even have time to? Falling into bed exhausted at the end of the day is just inevitable, isn't it? Or, it can be tempting to stay up late again. What's your normal?

Our modern lifestyles tend to continue at pace. Working days/nights probably have the same start and finish times all year round. We also prioritise routines around mealtimes, family-time, healthcare, social groups and whatever else seems important - then all too soon it's time for sleep.  ***Our bedtime sleep routine is important and is too often overlooked or compromised.***

## Routine Sundown tips



* Set a reminder timer to start winding down.  Ideally 30-60 minutes before you want to be going to sleep.

* Reduce lighting to signal to the brain that it's nearly time for sleep, just as a sunset signals to animals in the wild.

* No screens in the 30 minutes before sleep as this may keep the brain from going into sleep mode. (Don't ignore this one).

* Set a more calming mood maybe with soft music, gentle aromas, a few yoga poses, read a few pages of a book. 

* Write down something you are grateful for today.

* Take a deeper breath in, hold it for a few seconds... then let it out and imagine letting out all of the cares of the day.

* Think about sighing and yawning... then smile and welcome sleepiness.
