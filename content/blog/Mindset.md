## Starting with you

Are you back into your usual routine? Perhaps there seem to be so many tasks on your plate, your head feels in the clouds. Perhaps you want something to change but you just can't see how. When it's a bit foggy it can seem easier to carry on as usual. <br>
If you've read this far, you've already stopped for a few moments and maybe curious to start making that difference... easily.


## Start something new

Instead of trying to fix what hasn't been working well for you, why not try something new today for 5 minutes?

It can be anything that makes you smile, laugh, move a little more, clean something, tidy a small area, do a puzzle, listen to music, sing/hum... 
And you could choose to do the same thing for 5 minutes tomorrow if it was fun or was helpful to you, or you could choose to try something different for the 5 minutes.

Creating a habit of taking short breaks allows the mind to change focus and create new perspectives.

This might seem simply obvious or obviously simple, but often it's the simple things that make such a difference.
