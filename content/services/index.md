## HYPNOSIS

How many times have you been engrossed in a good book or film? It's easy to lose track of time if it's really absorbing, isn't it?  That's an example of focused attention.
 
Hypnosis is a completely natural state of focused attention.  We might enter this state several times a day and will have experienced it reading a good book, watching a film, doing various activities, going on a journey and in many other ways.  We can decide how much we want to engage in that experience, or we can come out of it quickly if interrupted by something we sense is urgent. 
 
Many people who have undertaken hypnosis say it's relaxing.  Relaxation is certainly good for our wellbeing and calming the parasympathetic nervous system, key to focusing on ourselves and exploring possibilities from within.  Deeper levels of hypnotic trance can be experienced during hypnotherapy to further connect with the subconscious mind for working on inner solutions.  A similar effect happens naturally during sleeping - perhaps you recall waking after a good sleep with the answer to a problem that's been on your mind? 

## HYPNOTHERAPY
 
We can bring about hypnosis, this natural altered state of awareness, by ourselves.  Much can be achieved through self-hypnosis, however, without some guidance, this can be limited by our personal subjective conscious viewpoint.  A trained hypnotherapist can encourage a person’s desired positive change in thoughts, feelings and behaviours by suggestion during hypnosis, guiding them to a more helpful perspective. 

Clinical hypnotherapy is a holistic talking therapy, tailored to the individual, to support a person towards their desired beneficial change.  Particularly over the last 20+ years, hypnotherapy has played a growing role in mind-body interventions. Through continuing scientific research and testimonials, there is increasing wider acknowledgement that using hypnosis draws on the power of the mind for positive effect.  Hypnotherapy has been recognised by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as effective in the management for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).  Currently, the NHS offer very limited access to hypnotherapy services.

Hypnotherapy is a complementary therapy and may be provided alongside professional healthcare, but is not a substitute for essential healthcare. 

## WORKING WITH ME

**I mainly provide online therapy sessions for clients and find this works well. I’m based in Waterlooville, Hampshire and can arrange to see clients face-to-face at suitable local hired venues in the Portsmouth area when available.**

Using a range of talking therapy, coaching and NLP techniques to suit my clients, I explain the techniques in a teaching style so that clients can practise between and beyond therapy sessions, including self-hypnosis. 

Before starting any therapy, it's important to find out if it's right for you and whether you are comfortable working with me.  My online clients can organise their therapy sessions around their schedule, in their own familiar and comfortable space.
 
The first step is to contact me for a brief and confidential chat about what you are looking to change or achieve.  Please consider taking this short step - just talking about it with me may bring a sense of less distress, less discomfort and potentially lighten the mood and be motivating.

I can work with clients to support the following:
 
* STRESS and ANXIETY
 
* PHOBIAS
 
* UNHELPFUL HABITS
 
* SLEEP PROBLEMS
 
* PAIN MANAGEMENT
 
* BOOSTING CONFIDENCE

## HYPNOTHERAPY SESSION FEES

I provide a tailored hypnotherapy service to each client.  By listening and asking some questions to understand the situation and what change or improvement is wanted, a therapeutic plan is developed from the first session. 

***Why not [**request a free call**]({{< ref "/contact" >}} "Contact Me") and discover how this could work for you? On hearing what you wish to achieve, I can guide on how many sessions may be suitable.
I’m happy to answer your questions and there’s no obligation to proceed.***

I request payment in advance to confirm each session booking, or in advance of the first session of a bundle of sessions purchased together.  My cancellation policy is 24 hours in advance of a booked and purchased session in order to receive a full payment refund with no cancellation charge. Otherwise the full session fee will be charged. If you want to reschedule, please let me have at least 24 hours notice.

When your first session is booked and confirmed, look forward to your ‘me time’ in a private and supportive environment. I’ll look forward to working with you towards your aspirations - whether that’s easing anxiety and discomfort or improving confidence to move forward.
